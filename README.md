# About
A practical introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below are steps for newcomers to get started working with this project, or start their own.

##  Visual Studio Code
VS Code is a text editor that works just like any other, but is specialized for editing code. It can be downloaded for free on at https://code.visualstudio.com/.

## Github
Github is a place where people and organizations can store and share their code's history (for free!). In Github, projects are called "Repositories". Even without an account, anybody can download a copy of any public repository on Github.

## Previewing Web Pages
If you download this repository from Github and open it's folder in VS Code, you can preview (A.K.A. "serve") the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Click the "Extensions" icon on the far-left side of VS Code, and install "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.
* This extension (or other similar ones) should have easy to follow instructions on how to use it to preview code in the browser.
